### Higher Order Optimization for Gradient Boosting Decision Trees

Here is the code and data for NeurIPS' 2022 Higher Order Optimization workshop paper: "Higher Order Optimization for Gradient Boosting Decision Trees".

It is based on py_boost: https://github.com/sb-ai-lab/Py-Boost

## Data

Data in the data folder were obtained by running the `create_data.py` file. Each dataset is retrieved from OpenML, and split in 80% train, 20% test.
